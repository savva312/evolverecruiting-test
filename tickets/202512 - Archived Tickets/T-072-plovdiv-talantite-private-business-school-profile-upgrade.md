## Goal

Upgrade the ЧСБУ ‘Талантите’ profile to the global high school profile template in `skills/high-school-profile-template/HIGH-SCHOOL-PROFILE-TEMPLATE.md`, preserving verified local insights while filling template sections with current, sourced data.

---

## Context

- Existing profile: `bulgaria/entities/schools/profiles/plovdiv/talantite-private-business-school/README.md`
- City directory: `bulgaria/entities/schools/profiles/plovdiv/`
- Keep the profile within this folder while aligning fully to the global template.
- Use `skills/high-school-profile-template/SKILL.md` and `skills/markdown-authoring` for structure, sourcing expectations, and style.

## Required outputs

- `bulgaria/entities/schools/profiles/plovdiv/talantite-private-business-school/README.md` updated to match the global high school profile template with current data and sources.

---

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Profile follows the sections and checklists from the global high school template with placeholders replaced or explicitly marked as open questions.
- [ ] Local facts are sourced or flagged for follow-up; no speculative claims.
- [ ] Profile remains at the same path with any new assets contained within the school folder; no broken links introduced.
- [ ] No files modified outside `Allowed write paths`.

---

## Notes/Context

- Key sources to validate: recent admissions outcomes, tuition/fees, counselor contacts, outbound destinations, and language/exam tracks.
- Capture outstanding gaps in an **Open Questions** section within the profile.
- Completion notes: Profile upgraded to global template with website-verified license/address/contact details; fees/outcomes/contacts left as open questions pending school confirmation.
